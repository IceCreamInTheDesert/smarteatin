//its also a sheet
//access from food tab
//add food items
//i was thinking add a TextField for food name and calories and maybe if u have the time add a feature where it takes the number of calories you have left to not exceed your budget, and recommend food under that category
//if youre wondering why im not using multiline comments its because i dont feel like it
